README

This application gives the user a Japanese idiom and its reading.
The idioms come from this API: https://corsservice.appspot.com/

It also provides the user with some information about their current conditions (based on their GPS location): the temperatures, the date, the day of the week, and the time.

The user also gets information about the current weather conditions via the background of the page. On mobile devices (or any device with a min-width of less than 1200 px), the user will see a JPEG image reflecting the current weather. On larger screens (i.e. a laptop or a desktop computer), the user will see an MP4 video.

The videos came from http://www.videezy.com/
The photos came from Pexels, from Francesco Ungaro, PhotoMIX Company, Donald Tong, brazil topno, Victor Miyata, Johannes Plenio, and Yuliya Ilkovych.

The user can also play some calming lo-fi music to "start a good day."
